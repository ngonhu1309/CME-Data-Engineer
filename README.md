# CME-Data-Engineer

## Description
This Python project primarily works with WTI Crude Oil futures and options contracts, processing oddly formatted SPAN files from the CME Group. The application reads a SPAN data file (such as cme.20210709.c.pa2), extracts important data (such strike prices, settlement prices, and contract expiration dates), and outputs the data in an easily readable format.
- To learn about WTI Crude Oil futures contract details, see: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude_contract_specifications.html
- According to the Type B Expanded documentation at https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/pubspan/Type+B+-+Expanded
- According to the Type 81 Expanded documentation at https://cmegroupclientsite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/pubspan/pages/46235915/Type+8+-+Expanded
  
## Usage
